- I added comments to the code to make it easier to understand. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
- This is very useful for students who are learning Visual Basic (although I'm also a student lololol) .


 There are three types of controls in Windows Forms:
 1. Common Controls: These are the controls that are used to take input from the user or display information to the user.
 2. Container Controls: These are the controls that are used to hold other controls.
 3. Dialog Controls: These are the controls that are used to interact with the user to perform a specific task.

 The following code demonstrates the use of common controls, container controls, and dialog controls in Windows Forms.
 All of this are also possible with the use of GitHub Copilot. Thank you ;)

 I added so many comments here to make it look it has so many lines of code. But in reality, its just a simple code.
